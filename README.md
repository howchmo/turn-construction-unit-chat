# Turn Construction Unit (TCU) Chat

A turn construction unit (TCU) is the fundamental segment of speech in a conversation, as analyzed in conversation analysis. Can we create a user interface (UI) for  chat that allows these to be properly organized in discourse.

Don't you hate it when you are asked several questions in chat but your response to each question is not linked to the original question because of the linear temporal flow of modern chat interfaces?  This project will explore a columnar interface to chat that allows responses to be related visually by relational context rather than time.  It will allow you to visually parse TCU's from the presentation of the digital text conversation.
